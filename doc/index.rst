Welcome to PypeIt's documentation!
==================================


PypeIt is a Python based data reduction pipeline (DRP) written
oringinally for echelle spectroscopy and since expanded
to low-resolution spectrometers.  This documentation details
the code, how to run it, and what it produces.

Release 1.0
===========

What this version provides
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Support for 10+ :doc:`spectrographs`
* Default reduction algorithms

  * Flatfielding with illumination pattern correction
  * :doc:`flexure` (spatial and spectral)
  * Full 2D wavelength solution (no rectification)
  * A-B image differencing
  * Global and local sky subtraction
  * Optimal (and boxcar) extractions

* Documentation

  * :doc:`installing`
  * :doc:`setup`
  * :doc:`pypeit_par`
  * :doc:`cookbook`
  * Data Models for (nearly) all output files
  * :doc:`fluxing`
  * :doc:`coadd1d`

* Scripts and Tools for Inspection

  * Slit Edges -- :ref:`master_edges:pypeit_chk_edges`
  * Flats -- :ref:`master_flat:pypeit_chk_flats`
  * 1D Spectra-- :ref:`out_spec1D:pypeit_show_1dspec`
  * 2D Spectra-- :ref:`out_spec2D:pypeit_show_2dspec`

* :doc:`quicklook`

What this version is missing (i.e. what we are working on)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Items

  * Telluric corrections
  * A-B image difference processing
  * 2D Coadds
  * Data model for MasterWaveCalib or MasterEdgeTrace calibration files

If you are mainly here to use PypeIt to reduce
your observational data then this section is for you.

Ideally, you will need to go no further than the few links
in this section take you.
