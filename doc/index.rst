======================

**Version**: 1.2.1dev

``PypeIt`` is a Python package for semi-automated reduction of
astronomical, spectroscopic data. Its algorithms build on
decades-long development of previous data reduction pipelines by the
developers. The reduction procedure - including a complete list of
the input parameters and available functionality - is provided by
this online documentation.

``PypeIt`` is a set of commands designed to perform the reduction
without any additional coding.

This release of ``PypeIt`` is designed to be used by both advanced
spectroscopists with prior data reduction expertise and astronomers
with no prior experience of data reduction. It is highly configurable
and designed to be applied to any standard slit-imaging spectrograph,
and can accommodate long-slit, multi-slit, as well as cross-dispersed
echelle spectra.

Users
=====

If you are mainly here to use ``PypeIt`` to reduce your observational
data then this section is for you. Ideally, you will need to go not
much further than the few links in this section take you.

If you have problems, we have a very active "PypeIt Users" Slack
workspace. We periodically update the invitation `here
<https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/issues/676>`__. If you find a bug
or have a feature request, please `submit an issue
<https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/issues>`__.
