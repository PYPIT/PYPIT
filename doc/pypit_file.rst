PYPIT Reduction File
====================

Overview
========

The primary file which informs the PYPIT data
reduction pipeline is referred to as the PYPIT
reduction file and it has a .pypit extension.  This
can be generated from PYPIT scripts (*recommended*)
or by-hand if you are sufficiently familiar with the code.

This document provides guidance on generating and modifying
the file.

We *recommend* that you generate a unique PYPIT file for each
instrument setup (modulo detectors) or for each target.
It is possible that you will need to modify the settings for
different gratings, etc.  It will also enable you to more
easily customize the associated calibration files to process.

Types
=====

For reference, we distinguish between several types of PYPIT
files.

Instrument PYPIT file
---------------------

For each instrument being reduced in a working folder,
the top-level PYPIT file is referred to as an *instrument*
PYPIT file.  It is intended to be used to generate the
instrument :doc:`setups` file and custom PYPIT files for the
full reductions.

The standard naming for the instrument PYPIT file is::

    instrument_date.pypit
    e.g., lris_blue_2016-Nov-23.pypit

Custom PYPIT file
-----------------

When one performs the full reduction on a set of files,
the *custom* PYPIT file is used.  We refer to it as custom
because it may be significantly customized for the specifc
instrument configuration and/or target.

While it is possible for a custom PYPIT files to be used
on more than one setup grouping, it is not recommended.

A typical naming scheme is by setups, e.g.::

    lris_blue_setup_01_02.pypit

although specifying by instrument configuration::

    kast_blue_600_4310_d55.pypit

or target::

    kast_blue_3C273.pypit

may be preferable.

.. _pypit_setup_pypit_files:

pypit_setup
===========

Here I will eventually descrbie how pypit_setup
generates a set of default, custom .pypit files.

By Example
==========

For reference, there are
existing PYPIT files in `PYPIT development suite
<https://github.com/PYPIT/PYPIT-development-suite>`_.
The PYPIT development suite is recommended for download
(see :doc:`installing`), and the relevant PYPIT files are located
in::

    PYPIT-development-suite/pypit_files/

You should be able to find one that matches your instrument.

.. _pypfile_by_line:

Line by line
============

This section will instruct you on how to build a .pypit
PYPIT file from scratch.  This is **not** recommended.
The following documentation is mainly for guiding
modifications to an existing PYPIT file.

Naming
++++++

Create a .pypit file. Name it anything you want, but for example,
it's useful to have: the instrument name, the grating or grism used,
the dichroic, etc. For example, we could call our PYPIT file
'lris_blue_long_600_4000_d560.pypit', for our data as collected
on LRIS's blue arm, in long slit mode, using the 600/4000 grism
and d560 dichroic.

You can make any comments in your PYPIT file with a
pound sign::

    # This is a comment line

We *recommend* you separate the main blocks of the .pypit file
with comments.

.. _run_block:

Run block
+++++++++

The first thing to include are changes to the
default settings related to running PYPIT.
The only one required is to set the name of the
spectrograph::

    run spectograph name_of_your_spectrograph

We do recommend including several others, and the
.pypit files made by the :ref:`pypit_pypfiles` script
includes most of the following.
Here are ones that one typically sets::

    # Change the default settings
    run ncpus 1                     # number of CPUs to use; can also negative integers,
                                    so -1 means all but one CPU
    run spectrograph lris_blue      # the spectrograph (+arm, if necessary) this set of data is from;
                                    see README for list of available instruments
    output verbosity 2                   # level of screen output; 0 = no output, 1 = low level of output;
                                    2 = output everything
    output overwrite True              # overwrite any existing output files?
    output sorted lris_blue_long_600_4000_d560     # name of output files

.. _reduce_block:

++++++++++++

.. _data_block:

Data block
++++++++++

Next, tell PYPIT where your raw data lives!
One specifies the full path and may use wild cards
to include a set of files.  If the data are compressed,
include that extension.  Multiple entires are allowed

Here is an example::

    # Read in the data
    data read
     /Users/path/to/your/raw/data/*.fits
    data end

If you wish to skip individual files, you can specify these
without the complete path, e.g.::

    skip LB.20160406.17832.fits

These will not be ignored as if they didn't exist.

.. _spect_block:

Spect block
+++++++++++

Then, give PYPIT some information about your raw data. For
example, PYPIT only accepts calibration files if they were
created within a time window of the science frame of interest.
You can set your own time window here. PYPIT also requires a
certain number of each type of calibration file to be matched
with the science frame, and here you can set what you want the
minimum to be::

    spect read
     #fits calwin 1000.     # calibration window; default window is 12 hrs;
                            here it is changed to 1000. hrs
     pixelflat number 1       # number of pixel flats needed for data reduction
     bias number 3          # number of bias frames; note that in this case,
                            PYPIT will combine the 3 biases into a master bias
     arc number 1           # number of arcs
     trace number 1         # number of trace frames
    spect end


In addition to the basic calibration settings above, you
may wish to redefine the frametype of a given file.
Here are some examples::

    spect read
     set bias     b150910_2036.fits.gz
     set bias     b150910_2037.fits.gz
     set bias     b150910_2038.fits.gz
     set pixelflat  b150910_2051.fits.gz
     set trace    b150910_2051.fits.gz
     set standard b150910_2083.fits.gz
    spect end


Whole enchilada
+++++++++++++++
With that, the most basic PYPIT file looks something like this::

    # Change the default settings
    run ncpus 1
    run spectrograph lris_blue
    output verbosity 2
    output overwrite True
    output sorted lris_blue_long_600_4000_d560

    # Read in the data
    data read
     /Users/path/to/your/raw/data/*.fits
    data end

    spect read
     #fits calwin 1000.

     pixelflat number 1
     bias number 3
     arc number 1
     trace number 1
    spect end

You can now run PYPIT with this .pypit settings file! See how in
:doc:`running`.
