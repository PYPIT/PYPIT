PypeIt QA
*********

As part of the standard reduction, PypeIt generates a series
of Quality Assurance (QA) files. This documentation describes
the typical outputs, in the typical order that they appear.
The basic arrangement is that individual PNG files are created
and then a set of HTML files are generated to organize
viewing of the PNGs.


HTML
====

When the code completes (or crashes out), a set of
HTML files are generated in the QA/ folder.  There
is one HTML file per MasterFrame set and one
HTML file per science exposure.  Example names are
MF_A_01_aa.html and J124_J1247-0337_LRISr_2017Mar20T140044.html.

Quick links are provided to allow one to jump between
the various files.


Calibration QA
==============

The first QA PNG files generated are related
to calibration processing.  There is a unique
one generated for each setup and detector and
(possibly) calibration set.

Generally, the title describes the type of QA and the
sub-title indicates the user who ran PypeIt and the
date of the processing.

.. _slit-edge-qa:

Slit Edge QA
------------

The first output is a plot showing the flat image of the given
detector.  The left/right slit edges are marked with red/cyan
dashed lines.  The slit name is labelled in green and the number
indicates the position of the slit center on the detector
mapped to the range [0-10000].
Here is an example:

.. figure:: qa/slit_trace_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center

.. _blaze-qa:

Blaze QA
--------

This page shows the blaze function measured from a flat-field
image, and the fit to this function.  There should be good
correspondence between the two.
Here is an example:

.. figure:: qa/blaze_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center

.. _wave-fit-qa:

Wavelength Fit QA
-----------------

This page shows the arc spectrum with labelled arc lines in
the left panel and the fit and residuals to the fit in the
right panels.  Good solutions should have RMS < 0.1 pixels.
Here is an example:

.. figure:: qa/arc_fit_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center


.. _spectral-tilts-qa:

Spectral Tilts QA
-----------------

There are generally a series of PNG files describing the analysis of the
tilts of the arc lines.

Arc Tilt PCA
++++++++++++

One page should show fits to the
PCA components describing the arcline tilt fits.  One hopes for
good models to the data (blue crosses; red crosses indicate
lines ignored in the analysis) in the first two panels,
and that the values for PC1 are small.  Here is an example:

.. figure:: qa/arc_pca_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center

Arc Tilt Plots
++++++++++++++

There are then a series of PNG files
showing the arc lines across the
detector (blue) and associated fits (red).  Here is
an example page:

.. figure:: qa/arc_tilts_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center


.. _exposure-qa:

Exposure QA
===========

For each processed, science exposure there are a series of
PNGs generated, per detector and (sometimes) per slit.


.. _object-trace-qa:

Object Trace QA
---------------

An image of the sky-subtracted slit is displayed.  Overlayed are the
left/right (red/cyan) edges of the extraction region for each object.
These are also labeled by the object ID value where the 3-digit number
is the trace position relative to the slit, ranging from 0-1000.
Here is an example:

.. figure:: qa/obj_trace_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center


Object Profile QA
-----------------

For all of the objects in a given slit
where optimal extraction was performed the
spatial profile and the fit are displayed.
The x-axis is in units of pixels.
Here is an example:

.. figure:: qa/obj_profile_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center


Flexure QA
----------

If a flexure correction was performed (default), the fit to the
correlation lags per object
is shown and the adopted shift is listed.  Here is
an example:

.. figure:: qa/flex_corr_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center


There is then a plot showing several sky lines
for the analysis of a single object (brightest)
from the data compared against an archived sky spectrum.
These should coincide well in wavelength.
Here is an example:

.. figure:: qa/flex_sky_armlsd.jpg
   :align: center
