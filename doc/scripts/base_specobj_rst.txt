SpecObj (1D spectra)
====================

This file describes the data model for the SpecObj class which is
written to disk as a multi-extension FITS file prefixed by `spec1d`
in the Science/ folder.

For each object detected in each slit in each detector, there is
on Table written to this FITS file.  The objects are named by the
spatial position (pixel number) on the reduced image, the slit number, and
the detector number, e.g. SPAT0176-SLIT0000-DET01.
