PypeIt, despite a pipeline for data *reduction*, is capable of generating
an inordinate amount of data products.  These pages document the
various data products and the means to control the output.  A
full description of the naming system is described 
:doc:`here </naming>`.

Standard Products
=================

There are four standard types of output products generated by PypeIt.
These separate calibrations from spectra and QA plots.  Each type is
designated by a unique prefix in the filename:

===========  ===========  ===========
Output Type  Prefix       Description
===========  ===========  ===========
1D Spectra   spec1d       1D arrays and meta data associated with extracted
                          1D spectra
Object info  objinfo      ASCII table listing several object attributes
2D Spectra   spec2d       2D arrays related to sources (e.g. sky-subtracted image)
Calibration  MasterFrame  Calibration images, fits, meta files, etc.
Reduction    N/A          Files that guide or describe the reduction
QA           qa           Quality assurance figures

Reduction Mode
==============

PypeIt can be run in several modes of reduction, which demark
the level of sophistication (e.g. quick and dirty vs. MonteCarlo)
and also the amount of output written to disk.  See ReductionModes
for a full description of these.  The Table below briefly summarizes
the standard outputs that are generated by each mode.  More detail
is given in the documentation describing each type of output products.

Compactness
===========

There are two modes for writing the output files which
differ in the number of files written.

.. _outputs-compactness-compact:

Compact
-------

Write the fewest files possible, generally one per each
of the :ref:`standard-products`. 
This is the PypeIt default for all :ref:`outputs-reduction-mode`.

.. _outputs-compactness-explode:

Explode
-------

Write approximately one file per reduction product.
